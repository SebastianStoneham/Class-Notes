    "- [ ] Modeling\n",
    "    - [ ] explore the modeling process\n",
    "    - [ ] determine appropriate models to use based on modeling objectives\n",
    "- [ ] Regression\n",
    "    - [ ] learn basic notation and terminology for regression models\n",
    "    - [ ] fit a regression with `statsmodels` and/or `sklearn`\n",
    "    - [ ] interpret mechanical meanings of coefficients for different variable types\n",
    "    - [ ] measure goodness of fit on a regression\n",
    "    - [ ] what does statistical significance tell us and not tell us\n",
    "- [ ] `sklearn` and Machine Learning\n",
    "    - [ ] understand objectives and development process of machine learning models\n",
    "    - [ ] you evaluate models using \"scoring metrics\"\n",
    "    - [ ] develop your intuition about how to select which metric fits a given problem\n",

    "- R^2 is the fraction of variation in y that a model can explain. \n",
    "    - how well model fits the data, or % of variation in y that model explains \n",
    "    - \"higher is better\"\n",
    "        - when you add vars to a model, R^2 cannot decrease (tendancy to overfit)\n",
    "        - so use adjusted R^2 : R^2 with a penalty for additional variables \n",
    "        - R^2 of 1 means that model goes through every single data point \n",
    "- can comparre 2 variables and see which line better fits the data it is describing \n",
    "\n",
    "# Interepreting Regression Coefficients Notes\n",
    "- log helps model proportional relationships \n",
    "    - by transforing varibales, we can change the interpretation of the relationship (log, polynomials, ect.)\n",
    "- interpretation is mechanical \n",
    "    - a (1 unit) increase in X is associaeted with a () change in Y, holding all else constant \n",
    "- binary variable, can be 1 of 2 options \n",
    "- categorical variable\n",
    "    - create variables for all except the base\n",
    "    - in other words create a dummy varibale for each condition except for base\n",
    "    - all dummy variables are relative to the ommited base group\n",
    "    - can create categorical varibales like industry\n",
    "- x as an interaction term \n",
    "- when other controls are included \n",
    "- when other categorical varibales are included \n",
    "- The change in the varibale, its magnitude, is dependent on how much the corresponding varibales varries\n",
    "    - going up or down a unit can be more common for some variables and rare for others "
